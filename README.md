# Intune Script and Configuration Samples

This repository is for macOS and Windows Intune sample scripts and custom configuration profiles. There are many cases where it is necessary to use a custom profile or shell script to accomplish a task.

To make things a little easier to navigate the repo has been split up into two main sections:

## MacOS

This section is for MacOS devices.

```
├── MacOS
│   ├── Apps
│   ├── Custom Profiles
│   ├── Meraki SM
│   └── Misc
```
## Windows

This section is for Windows devices.

```
├── Windows
│   ├── Apps
│   ├── Scripts
│   └── Meraki SM
```

### Disclaimer
Understand the impact of each sample script prior to running it.

### Contributing
